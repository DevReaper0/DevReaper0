### Hello! 👋

I'm _DevReaper0_, a student programmer who has been writing code since early 2019. I also dabble a bit in creating digital art and music.

#### 💻 My current main projects:

-   _[Libra](https://github.com/LibraMusic)_, a new, open, and extensible music service
-   _[Nova](https://github.com/LibraMusic/Nova)_, a [GoReleaser](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser) fork with additional features and some breaking changes
-   _[DeclArch](https://github.com/DevReaper0/declarch)_, a tool for declaratively managing (currently only Arch Linux) systems
-   _[Cloud](https://github.com/CloudLoaderMC/CloudLoader)_, a hybrid mod loader for Minecraft aiming to actively support as many other loaders' mods as possible

#### ⌨️ Some other cool projects:

-   _[ParaCode](https://github.com/ParaCodeLang/ParaCode)_, a prototypical programming language with a knack for extensibility
-   _[Spirit](https://gitlab.com/DevReaper0/SpiritEngine)_, a simple, lightweight 2D OpenGL game engine
-   _[CookieClicker++](https://github.com/DevReaper0/CookieClickerPlusPlus)_, a way to load Cookie Clicker but store saves in the cloud
-   _[NewOS](https://github.com/DevReaper0/NewOS)_, a very barebones operating system

#### 🌐 I know a larger variety of languages, but these are my current favorites:

1. _Go_
2. _Rust_
3. _Python_
4. _Lua_
